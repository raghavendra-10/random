Marinate the Chicken:

    In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt to create a marinade.
    Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them well. Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour (longer marination yields more flavorful results).
Cook the Chicken:

    Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat.
    Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
    Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
    Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.
Add Spices:

    Add cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.
Cook the Masala:

    Add marinated chicken to the pan and mix well with the masala. Cook for a few minutes until the chicken starts to brown.
Simmer and Finish:

    Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the chicken cook in its own juices. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
    Once the chicken is cooked and tender, sprinkle garam masala and mix well.
    Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
Garnish and Serve:

    Garnish the Spicy Chicken Masala with chopped cilantro leaves.
    Serve hot with naan, roti, rice, or any Indian bread of your choice.
    Remember, the spiciness of the dish can be adjusted by varying the amount of red chili powder and green chilies according to your taste preferences. Enjoy!
