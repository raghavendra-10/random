   <div><pre>Prepare Nihari Masala (Spice Mix):
    Dry roast all the whole spices (coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom pods, black cardamom, dried bay leaves, nutmeg, and dried red chilies) in a pan over low heat until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.
    Allow the roasted spices to cool, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Set aside.
Cook the Mutton:
    Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker over medium heat.
    Add sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
    Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.
    Add mutton pieces and sear them until they are browned on all sides.
Add Spices:

    Add Nihari masala, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the mutton with the spices.
Slow Cooking:

    Add water and bring the mixture to a boil. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
    Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer slowly for 4-6 hours. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 1-2 hours until the meat is tender and falls off the bone.
Finish and Serve:

    Once the meat is tender and the gravy has thickened, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
    Garnish with chopped cilantro and sliced ginger.
    Serve hot with roti, naan, or steamed rice. Accompany with lemon wedges for squeezing over the Nihari before eating.
Nihari is best enjoyed with its rich and flavorful gravy, so make sure to cook it slowly to achieve the desired consistency and taste.
