        Take a tray and marinate with yoghurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, turmeric and salt. If you want to make it more spicy and flavoursome, add finely chopped green chilies along with some finely chopped coriander leaves. Although, this will slightly change the traditional fish fry but at the same it will enhance the taste. Add all the ingredients (except oil) to the fish and mix well. Keep aside for half an hour.
        Deep fry it to perfection
Now heat oil in a deep fry pan to shallow fry the fish pieces one by one, keeping the flame low. Drain the fried fish pieces and place on an absorbent paper to remove excess oil.
Serve Fish Fry hot
Serve the Fish Fry hot with green chutney and onion rings. You can also serve it with mustard sauce or any dip.
