   <div><pre>For the Kulcha Dough:

    In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
    
    Add yogurt and oil to the dry ingredients. Mix well.
    
    Gradually add water and knead to form a soft and smooth dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 2 hours.
    
For the Paneer Filling:
    
    Heat oil in a pan. Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
    
    Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
    
    Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft.
    
    Add red chili powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.
    
    Add crumbled paneer and chopped coriander leaves. Cook for a few minutes until the paneer absorbs the flavors. Remove from heat and let the filling cool.
    
    To Make Paneer Kulcha:
    
    Divide the rested kulcha dough into equal-sized balls.
    
    Take a dough ball, flatten it slightly, and place a spoonful of the paneer filling in the center.
    
    Gather the edges of the dough and seal the filling inside. Flatten the stuffed dough ball gently.
    
    Dust the flattened dough with flour and roll it out into a slightly thick oval or round shape.
    
    Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Place the rolled kulcha onto the hot tawa.
    
    Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, then flip the kulcha and cook the other side.
    
    Apply ghee or oil on both sides of the kulcha and cook until golden brown spots appear.
    
    Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
    
    Serve the hot and delicious Paneer Kulchas with yogurt, pickles, or chutney.
