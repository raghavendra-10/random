        <h1>dosa</h1>
        <pre>
            In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice.
            To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi).
            Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep them aside.
            In a separate bowl, take 2 tablespoons of thick poha (flattened rice or parched rice).
            Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind or blend till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of the batter is also fine.

            If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again.
            
            Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches. I ground in two batches and added a total of ¾ cup water.
