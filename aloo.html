   <div><pre>Boil the Potatoes:

    Peel and dice the potatoes into bite-sized cubes.
    Boil the potatoes until they are just tender. Drain and set aside.
    Prepare the Spinach:
    
    Wash the spinach leaves thoroughly and chop them.
    Blanch the spinach: Boil water in a pot and blanch the spinach leaves for about 1-2 minutes. Immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water to retain their vibrant green color. Drain and blend to a smooth paste. Set aside.
Cook the Aloo Palak:
    
    Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat.
    Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
    Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.
    Add ginger and garlic paste, and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
    Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and the oil starts to separate.
    Add Spices:
    
    Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.
Add Blended Spinach:
    
    Add the blended spinach paste to the pan and mix well with the spice mixture. Cook for a few minutes.
    Add Potatoes:
    
    Add the boiled and diced potatoes to the pan. Mix gently to coat the potatoes with the spinach mixture.
Simmer and Finish:
    
    Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the flavors meld for about 5-7 minutes. If the mixture looks dry, you can add a little water.
Garnish and Serve:
    
    Sprinkle garam masala and chopped green chilies over the Aloo Palak.
    Give it a gentle stir and turn off the heat.
    Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.
    Feel free to adjust the spice levels and ingredients according to your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade Aloo Palak!
